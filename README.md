# Corner Grocer Project
The app was made to keep track of data input through a readable file and then convert that file into data that made it easier to get an overview of the daily sales for a grocery store. This data was presented through daily totals and a text based histogram

I believe I handled the presentation of the new data very well. The code is easy to read and understand and the final print for the code is presented nicely. However, I believe I can improve in the error handling department for c++. Due to the way cin works its difficult for me to logically program a error handling solution even with general error handling code. 

  The hardest part of the code to write was the histogram. That was only because of the logical process however. The implentation is straitforeward as long as you know how arrays and variables work together. Ill be on stack overflow a lot more in order to increase my support network.
  
  One of the best skills I got from this project was learning how to leverage the strengths and weaknesses of two different languages together to create a proper project. This is going to be essential in the future as large corporations generally use what works for a project so specializiing might not always be an option.
  
  The best way to make a program maintainable and readable is proper commenting and function creation which I made sure to properly implement here. None of the functions are very convoluted in their execution and most of them have easy to understand logic and comments to aid with that.
